# Runtime Flow

## Overview

Navi is a queue-based cache-warmer. It reads a YAML configuration file, enqueues HTTP requests as jobs, and processes them concurrently using a pool of workers.

```
navi.js (CLI entrypoint — project root)
  └─ Application.loadConfig(configPath)
       ├─ Config  ──────────────────────────────────────── clients + resources
       │    ├─ ClientRegistry   (named HTTP clients)
       │    ├─ ResourceRegistry (named resource groups)
       │    └─ WorkersConfig    (pool size)
       ├─ JobRegistry  ──── main queue + failed queue + deadJobs + finished list
       └─ WorkersRegistry ─ idle/busy worker pool (created via WorkersFactory)
            └─ Worker[]  ──── each processes one Job at a time (async)
                 └─ Job.perform()
                      ├─ Client.perform(resourceRequest)  → raw response body
                      └─ resourceRequest.executeActions(rawBody)
                           ├─ ResponseParser   → parse JSON once
                           └─ ActionsExecutor  → normalise + dispatch per item
                                └─ ResourceRequestAction.execute(item)
                                     └─ VariablesMapper.map(item) → log vars
```

## 1. Entrypoint — `navi.js`

The CLI script `navi.js` (project root) reads command-line arguments to determine which YAML configuration file to load.
It instantiates `Application`, calls `loadConfig(configPath)`, and then starts the `Engine`.

---

## 2. Configuration Loading

`Application.loadConfig(configPath)` orchestrates initialization:

1. `ConfigLoader` reads the YAML file from disk (`fs.readFileSync` + `yaml` library).
2. `ConfigParser` validates required top-level keys and builds:
   - `ClientRegistry` — named HTTP client definitions (`base_url`, optional headers/auth).
   - `ResourceRegistry` — named resource groups, each containing one or more `ResourceRequest` entries.
   - `WorkersConfig` — worker pool size (`workers.quantity`, default 1).
3. `JobRegistry` is created (empty queues).
4. `WorkersRegistry` is created and `initWorkers()` is called, which uses **`WorkersFactory`** (planned — not yet implemented) to instantiate the configured number of `Worker` instances (each with a UUID).

---

## 3. Configuration Structure

```yaml
workers:
  quantity: 5          # number of concurrent workers

web:
  port: 3000           # port for the monitoring web UI (omit to disable)

clients:
  default:
    base_url: https://example.com
  auth_api:
    base_url: https://api.example.com
    headers:
      Authorization: Bearer <token>

resources:
  categories:
    - url: /categories.html
      status: 302
    - url: /categories.json
      status: 200
      actions:
        - resource: category_information  # no variables_map → all fields pass through
        - resource: products
          variables_map:
            id: category_id   # response field "id" → variable "category_id"
  category_information:
    - url: /categories/{:id}.json
      status: 200
      client: auth_api      # use a specific named client for this request
      actions:
        - resource: kind
          variables_map:
            kind_id: id       # response field "kind_id" → variable "id"
  products:
    - url: /categories/{:category_id}/products.json
      status: 200
  kind:
    - url: /kinds/{:id}.json
      status: 200
```

Each `ResourceRequest` entry may specify:

- `url` — URL template, optionally containing `{:placeholder}` tokens.
- `status` — expected HTTP response status code.
- `client` — name of the client to use (falls back to `default`).
- `actions` — optional list of actions to execute after a successful response (see section 6).

The optional top-level `web:` key configures the monitoring web UI:

- `port` — TCP port where the Express web server listens. Omit the `web:` key entirely to run Navi without a web server.

---

## 4. Initial Enqueueing

After `loadConfig`, `Application` iterates over all `ResourceRequest` entries across all resources and enqueues those that **require no parameters** (i.e., their URL contains no `{:placeholder}` tokens).

`JobRegistry.enqueue(resourceRequest, params)`:

1. Delegates to **`JobFactory`** to create a new `Job` wrapping the `ResourceRequest` and parameter map.
2. Calls `push(job)` to add the job to the tail of the main queue.

---

## 5. Engine Loop

**`Engine`** drives the processing lifecycle by delegating job assignment to the `WorkersAllocator`.

### Main allocation loop

The Engine continuously calls the `WorkersAllocator` to assign jobs to workers as long as there is remaining work:

- Remaining work means: at least one busy worker **or** at least one job in the queue.
  - `WorkersRegistry.hasBusyWorker()` — returns `true` if any worker is currently processing.
  - `JobRegistry.hasJob()` — returns `true` if there are jobs to process (main or failed queue).

The allocation loop:

1. While there is remaining work, the Engine calls `WorkersAllocator.allocate()`.
2. The `WorkersAllocator` assigns jobs to idle workers as long as both are available, using extensible allocation logic.
3. If no idle workers are available but work remains, the Engine may sleep for a configurable duration before retrying (future: configurable sleep).
4. The loop stops when all jobs are processed and all workers are idle.

This design decouples the engine's control flow from the job assignment logic, making it easier to test and extend allocation strategies.

When the main queue is empty, the inner loop may promote jobs from the failed queue back to the main queue, giving previously failed requests a retry window after the rest of the work has been attempted.

---

## 6. Worker Execution

Each `Worker` processes one job at a time asynchronously:

1. **Resolve client** — look up the client named in `ResourceRequest` (or `default`) from `ClientRegistry`.
2. **Resolve URL** — expand `{:placeholder}` tokens in the URL template using the job's parameter map.
3. **Perform request** — call `Client.perform(resourceRequest, params)`; throws `RequestFailed` if the response status does not match the expected status.
4. **Parse response** — pass the HTTP response body to **`ResponseParser`**, which extracts the data needed for downstream jobs.
5. **Enqueue actions** — for each entry in `ResourceRequest.actions`, call `JobRegistry.enqueue(downstreamRequest, mappedParams)` using the parameter mappings defined in the action configuration.
6. **Finish** — mark the job as finished and store it in `JobRegistry`'s finished list; call `WorkersRegistry.setIdle(workerId)` so the worker re-enters the idle pool.

### Action Parameter Mapping Example

Given a response body `[{ id: 1 }, { id: 2 }]` and the following actions config:

```yaml
actions:
  - resource: category
    params:
      id: id          # job param "id" = response field "id"
  - resource: items
    params:
      category_id: id # job param "category_id" = response field "id"
```

For each item in the response array, two sets of jobs are enqueued — **4 jobs in total** (2 resources × 2 IDs):

- All `ResourceRequest` entries under `category` with `params: { id: 1 }` and `{ id: 2 }` (2 jobs).
- All `ResourceRequest` entries under `items` with `params: { category_id: 1 }` and `{ category_id: 2 }` (2 jobs).

---

## 7. Failure Handling

When a job fails (e.g., `RequestFailed` is thrown):

1. The job's **failure counter** is incremented and the **last exception** is stored on the job.
2. If the failure count is within the configured maximum, the job is moved to the **failed queue**.
3. If the failure count exceeds the configured maximum, the job is moved to **`deadJobs`**.

The failed queue is only promoted to the main queue **after the main queue is empty**, giving the server time to recover from transient errors before retrying.

All queues (`main`, `failed`, `finished`, `deadJobs`) are managed inside `JobRegistry`.

---

## 8. Web UI

When the `web:` key is present in the configuration, `Application` starts a local **read-only monitoring web UI** built with React + React Bootstrap. It is served by an Express.js `WebServer` on the configured port.

The web UI displays:

- Jobs currently in queue.
- Jobs being processed.
- Finished jobs.
- Failed jobs (with last failure reason).
- Dead jobs (exceeded retry limit).

To enable it, add the following to your configuration file:

```yaml
web:
  port: 3000
```

Omit the `web:` key entirely to run Navi in headless mode (no web server).
